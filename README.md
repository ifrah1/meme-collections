## Approach: 
To create this app i used Trello to help me organize my work. I started with the wireframe and creating the relationships for this app. Then as I finished the tasks I updated my tasks. As I created each routes for my application I made sure the route was working and I could see the current view once the link was clicked. Once I saw that then I implanted my view and controller for that route.
